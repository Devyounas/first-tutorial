                        <p>Small letters, with their compact and detailed forms, are designed to create a seamless flow between words, making text easy to read and visually pleasing. Gothic small letters, known for their intricate and angular shapes, add a sense of boldness and structure to the text, often evoking a historical or medieval aesthetic. On the other hand, Italic and Copperplate small letters present a more fluid and natural design. Italic letters are slanted and graceful, providing a dynamic flow that emphasizes elegance and movement. Copperplate small letters, while also fluid, carry an even more refined and balanced appearance, highlighting readability and harmony.</p>

                        <p>Flourishes are elegant, decorative extensions or embellishments that are added to letters, significantly enhancing their visual appeal. These intricate details often appear as curving lines, swirls, or delicate accents that extend from the strokes of the letters, giving them a refined and artistic touch. Flourishes are commonly used in formal and artistic designs where the goal is to evoke a sense of luxury, grace, and sophistication. They are particularly popular in wedding invitations, greeting cards, or luxury branding, where they help create an elevated and distinguished look. </p>
